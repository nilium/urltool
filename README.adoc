== Name

urltool - modify URLs from the command line


== Synopsis

*urltool* [_-h|-help_] _<url>_... [_modifier_...]

== Description

urltool is a small tool to parse and optionally modify URLs from the command
line.

If urltool encounters an invalid URL, it will exit with status 1 after writing
an error message to standard error. urltool may print partial results in the
case of an error.

== Options
